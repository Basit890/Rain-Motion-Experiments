Project 1: House in Rainfall
This project simulates a house in a rainy environment using Pygame and OpenGL. The rain effect is achieved through animated falling lines, and the house is rendered using basic OpenGL shapes.
Features:
Animated rainfall effect
Static house rendering
Uses OpenGL transformations


Project 2: Amazing Animated Box
This project features an animated, interactive 2D box using OpenGL and Pygame. The box rotates and moves based on user input.
Features:
2D rotation and movement
Keyboard-controlled interaction
OpenGL transformations for smooth animation


Install dependencies:
 pip install -r requirements.txt



Usage
Run the scripts individually:
House in Rainfall.py
Animated Box.py


Dependencies
